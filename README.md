# How-I-did-on-Assignment-1

For the first assignment I felt I did pretty well. There was a bit of a learning curve at the beginning because Github is difficult to use. It took me a long time to figure out how to upload images of my own and write the code to get them to display properly within my document. After I had figured out how to use Github though, the rest of the assignment came fairly easily. I think the first assignment was definitley good practice for us as students because there are so many instructional documents out there. No matter what field you're in, there's going to come a time when you don't know how to do something and most likely you're going to turn to the internet for help. I think it's a good skill to know how to write a well-written instructional document ourselves. Also, I liked how this assignment allowed us to work on skills in our area of expertise. I felt like I killed two birds with one stone; I was able to write a paper, and brush up on some tablet skills for Graphic Art.
